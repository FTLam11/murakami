# Murakami
## Chicago Fiery Skippers 2016 Phase 3 Group Project
### Team Green Salmon are : Alex Wen, Elizabeth Alexander, Jack Thatcher, and Frank Lam

### Purpose
Murakami is a virtual book club mobile app that allows readers to share reactions and discuss books they are reading. We felt that many readers are missing an outlet to discuss their thoughts and feelings, and Murakami can serve as a platform to encourage open exchange as well as find more books to read.
