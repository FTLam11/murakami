  Parameters: {"author"=>"Nick Bilton", "title"=>"Hatching Twitter", "description"=>"A New York Times bestseller Ev told Jack he had to “chill out” with the deluge of media he was doing. “It’s bad for the company,” Ev said. “It’s sending the wrong message.” Biz sat between them, watching like a spectator at a tennis match. “But I invented Twitter,” Jack said. “No, you didn’t invent Twitter,” Ev replied. “I didn’t invent Twitter either. Neither did Biz. People don’t invent things on the Internet. They simply expand on an idea that already exists.” Despite all the coverage of Twitter’s rise, Nick Bilton of The New York Times is the first journalist to tell the full story—a gripping drama of betrayed friendships and highstakes power struggles. The four founders—Evan Williams, Biz Stone, Jack Dorsey, and Noah Glass—made a dizzyingly fast transition from ordinary engineers to wealthy celebrities. They fought each other bitterly for money, influence, publicity, and control as Twitter grew larger and more powerful. Ultimately they all lost their grip on it. Bilton’s unprecedented access and exhaustive reporting have enabled him to write an intimate portrait of four friends who accidentally changed the world, and what they all learned along the way.", "image_url"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ygwDHny6vpkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "pageCount"=>320, "publishedDate"=>"2013-11-05", "chapter_count"=>568, "user_id"=>"31", "book"=>{"title"=>"Hatching Twitter", "author"=>"Nick Bilton", "image_url"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ygwDHny6vpkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}

Since publication in 1991 of the award-winning, epoch-making Frank in the River, these lusciously hypnotic fables have dazzled cartoon lovers the world over. Frank is a generic anthropomorph who lives in a world of mysterious and dangerous beauty. Propelled by forces beyond his control, including his own unquenchable curiosity, he finds himself in one bizarre escapade after another, frequently involving the loathsome Manhog or the power-hungry Whim. Luckily, Frank has a protector and ally in the form of his feisty godling companion, Pupshaw. Frank's adventures are told in a series of nearly wordless cartoon stories that draw readers deep into a hallucinatory mindscape governed by a profound interior logic that raises the Frank Book to a level above fantasy. As Francis Ford Coppola says in his introduction, \"The ancient myths and folk tales of all cultures which have been preserved for so many centuries have meaning for us today because the fantastic elements in them are rooted in immutable reality. The Frank stories belong to this class of literature.\" Book jacket.", "image_url"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WMc3AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "pageCount"=>351, "publishedDate"=>"2003-07-08", "chapter_count"=>25, "user_id"=>"31", "book"=>{"title"=>"The Frank book", "author"=>"Jim Woodring", "image_url"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WMc3AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"}}

  Parameters: {"author"=>"Alex Honnold", "title"=>"Alone on the Wall", "description"=>"The life and death-defying feats of Alex Honnold, a visionary climber of the sort that comes along only once in a generation. Only a few years ago, Alex Honnold was little known beyond a small circle of hardcore climbers. Today, at the age of thirty, he is probably the most famous adventure athlete in the world. In that short time, he has proven his expertise in many styles of climbing and has shattered speed records, pioneered routes, and won awards within each discipline. More spectacularly still, he has pushed the most extreme and dangerous form of climbing far beyond the limits of what anyone thought was possible. Free soloing, Honnold’s specialty, is a type of climbing performed without a rope, a partner, or hardware—such as pitons, nuts, or cams—for aid or protection. The results of climbing this way are breathtaking, but the stakes are ultimate: if you fall, you die. In Alone on the Wall, Honnold recounts the seven most astonishing climbing achievements so far in his meteoric and still-evolving career. He narrates the drama of each climb, along with reflective passages that illuminate the inner workings of his highly perceptive and discerning mind. We share in the jitters and excitements he feels waking in his van (where he lives full time) before a climb; we see him self-criticize in his climbing journal (a veritable bible for students of the sport); and we learn his secrets to managing fear—his most enviable talent. Veteran climber and award-winning author David Roberts writes part of each chapter in his own voice, and he calls on other climbers and the sport’s storied past to put Alex's tremendous accomplishments in perspective. Whenever Honnold speaks in public, he is asked the same two questions: \"Aren't you afraid you're going to die?\" and \"Why do you do this?\" Alone on the Wall takes us around the world and through the highs and lows in the life of a climbing superstar to answer those fascinating questions. Honnold's extraordinary life, and his idiosyncratic worldview, have much to teach us about risk, reward, and the ability to maintain a singular focus, even in the face of extreme danger.", "image_url"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BepwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api", "pageCount"=>288, "publishedDate"=>"2015-11-09", "chapter_count"=>56, "user_id"=>"31", "book"=>{"title"=>"Alone on the Wall", "author"=>"Alex Honnold", "image_url"=>"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=BepwBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"}}
