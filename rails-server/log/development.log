It has since been viewed more than 50 million times and has spawned eight sequels and many, many dedicated fans. Now, for the first time, the weird and wonderful world of asdf has exploded onto the page in ART IS DEAD, a book conceived and written by Tom and illustrated by Matt Ley. Featuring much-loved characters from the films, as well as brand-new, never-before-seen comics and bonus material - including the asdf origin story and Tom's own sketches - ART IS DEAD is a comic book like no other. Expect trains, potatoes, suicidal muffins and jokes about \"death, destruction and things talking that don't normally talk\", all wrapped up in book so awkwardly shaped it will make your shelves look weird. (Sorry about that.)"}}
